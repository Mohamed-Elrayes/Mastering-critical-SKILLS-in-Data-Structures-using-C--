# Mastering Data Structures

## Overview
Almost all other courses focus on knowledge. In this course, we focus on gaining real skills.

### Overall
- The course covers basic to advanced data structures.
- Learn the inner details of the data structures and their time & memory complexity analysis.
- Learn how to code line-by-line.
- Source code and slides are provided for all content.
- An extensive amount of practice to master the taught data structures (where most other content fails!).
- ~180 problems from easy to hard!

## Content
- Asymptotic Complexity
- Vector
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Project: Sparse Array and Matrix
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- Binary Heap
- AVL Tree
- Letter Tree (Trie)
- Hash Table
- Extensive Homework sets with video solutions

## Teaching Style
Instead of long theory then coding style, we follow a unique style:
- Parallelize the concepts with the codes as much as possible.
- Go concrete as possible.
- Use clear visualization.

## By the end of the journey
- Solid understanding of Data Structures topics in C++.
- Mastering different skills:
  - Analytical and Problem-Solving skills.
  - Clean coding for data structures.
  - Black-box applying on DS.
- With the administered problem-solving skills:
  - You can start competitive programming smoothly [DS type].
  - Smooth start in Algorithms course.
  - One more step toward interviews preparation.

## Prerequisites
Programming Skills:
- Up to arrays & functions.
- Comfortable with recursive functions.
- Comfortable with pointers.
- Basics of OOP: Just Class, Private and Public Sections.
Preferred:
- Learning and using STL.
- Project Building Skills.
- Basic Programming Problem-Solving Skills.

It is going to be a transformative experience. Please read reviews to get a flavor of that. It is not going to be easy work. It will be a Stanford-like course. You can skip homework if you want an easier or shorter learning experience.

Don't miss such a unique learning experience!

### What youâ€™ll learn
- Learn from basic to advanced data structures.
- ~180 explained problems from Easy to Medium to Hard + quizzes.
- Well-written and modular short codes.
- Short but very informative and deep material.
- A fundamental step toward improving problem-solving skills.
- A fundamental step toward interviews preparation.
- Algorithms course should be an easier learning experience.

### Are there any course requirements or prerequisites?
- Programming skills, Recursion, Pointers, and Class Little Basics.

### Who this course is for:
- Mastering inner details of several important data structures.
- Not just learn, but strongly apply & alter data structures.
- Whoever wants to master more of computer science fundamentals.
